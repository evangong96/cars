# Cars and Fuel Usage
## By Evan Gong
This is a dataset about cars and how much fuel they use. In this visualization, I extracted the number of horsepowers, as well as the City MPG from the dataset and created a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the number of horsepowers in a car and its fuel efficiency. Clearly, the higher number of horsepowers, the worse fuel efficiency. The source of this data is from [CORGIS](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/cars/).
